# AutoHack_tool
##A automatic reconaissance and hacking tool. 

It's made with python and utilizes the "scapy" module for a couple of functions.

It can:
- Scan networks for online hosts.
- Scan for open ports and the services running on it (and its versions).
- Can enumerate login credentials.
- And much more! (in the future).
